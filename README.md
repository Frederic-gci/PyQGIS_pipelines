# QGIS pipelines 

PyQGIS based pipelines for the transformation of geospatial data for the AURIGE and ORACLE-2 projects.

## Prerequisites

The pipelines use the QGIS environment and libraries. They are meant to be launched from the Python executable of a working QGIS installation (on Windows, launch from python-qgis.bat). To install QGIS, refer to [QGIS download](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).
